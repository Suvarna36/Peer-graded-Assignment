## Introduction to Data Science

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines various techniques from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze, interpret, and derive meaningful insights from data.

Key components of data science include:

- Data Collection: Gathering and acquiring data from various sources.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and exploring data to understand its characteristics and patterns.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
- Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling: Building predictive models to make data-driven decisions.
- Data Visualization: Presenting insights and findings through graphs, charts, and visual representations.
- Interpretation and Communication: Extracting actionable insights and communicating them effectively to stakeholders.

Data scientists use a variety of tools and programming languages like Python, R, SQL, and others to perform these tasks and extract meaningful information from data for decision-making and problem-solving across diverse industries.

# Arithmetic Expressions Examples

Arithmetic expressions are fundamental mathematical operations performed on numerical values using operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They follow the basic principles of arithmetic and can involve constants, variables, and mathematical operations.

### Basic Operators:

1. **Addition (+):** Adding two or more numbers. Example: `3 + 5 = 8`.
2. **Subtraction (-):** Subtracting one number from another. Example: `10 - 4 = 6`.
3. **Multiplication (*):** Multiplying two or more numbers. Example: `6 * 2 = 12`.
4. **Division (/):** Dividing one number by another. Example: `20 / 4 = 5`.
5. **Exponentiation (** or ^):** Raising a number to a power. Example: `2 ** 3 = 8` (2 raised to the power of 3).

### Complex Expressions:

Arithmetic expressions can be more complex by combining multiple operations and following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to evaluate them correctly:

- **Parentheses ():** Used to specify the order of operations. Example: `(3 + 4) * 2 = 14`.
- **Multiple Operations:** Expressions can involve multiple operations. Example: `5 + 3 * 2 = 11` (Follows order of operations: multiplication before addition).

Understanding arithmetic expressions is essential for performing calculations in various fields, including mathematics, programming, finance, and more.

# Multiplication and Addition of Numbers
# Define numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
num3 = 2

# Perform multiplication and addition
result_multiply = num1 * num2  # Multiplication
result_add = num1 + num3  # Addition

# Print the results
print("Multiplication Result:", result_multiply)
print("Addition Result:", result_add)

# Convert Minutes to Hours
# Define minutes
minutes = 120

# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60  # 1 hour = 60 minutes

# Print the result
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours")
