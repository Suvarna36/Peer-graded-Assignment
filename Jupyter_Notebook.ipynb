They follow the basic principles of arithmetic and can involve constants, variables, and mathematical operations.\n","\n","### Basic Operators:\n","\n","1. **Addition (+):** Adding two or more numbers. Example: `3 + 5 = 8`.\n","2. **Subtraction (-):** Subtracting one number from another. Example: `10 - 4 = 6`.\n","3. **Multiplication (*):** Multiplying two or more numbers. Example: `6 * 2 = 12`.\n","4. **Division (/):** Dividing one number by another. Example: `20 / 4 = 5`.\n","5. **Exponentiation (** or ^):** Raising a number to a power. Example: `2 ** 3 = 8` (2 raised to the power of 3).\n","\n","## Complex Expressions:\n","\n","Arithmetic expressions can be more complex by combining multiple operations and following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to evaluate them correctly:\n","\n","- **Parentheses ():** Used to specify the order of operations. Example: `(3 + 4) * 2 = 14`.\n","- **Multiple Operations:** Expressions can involve multiple operations. Example: `5 + 3 * 2 = 11` (Follows order of operations: multiplication before addition).\n","\n","Understanding arithmetic expressions is essential for performing calculations in various fields, including mathematics, programming, finance, and more.\n","\n","### Multiplication and Addition of Numbers\n","### Define numbers\n","num1 = 5\n","num2 = 3\n","num3 = 2\n","\n","### Perform multiplication and addition\n","result_multiply = num1 * num2  # Multiplication\n","result_add = num1 + num3  # Addition\n","\n","### Print the results\n","print(\"Multiplication Result:\", result_multiply)\n","print(\"Addition Result:\", result_add)\n","\n","## Convert Minutes to Hours\n","### Define minutes\n","minutes = 120\n","\n","### Convert minutes to hours\n","hours = minutes / 60  # 1 hour = 60 minutes\n","\n","### Print the result\n","print(f\"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours\")\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","1. **Introduction to Data Science:** Understanding the fundamentals and scope of data science.\n","2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Learning techniques to gather and clean data.\n","3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding data characteristics and patterns.\n","4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating or modifying features to improve model performance.\n","5. **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Understanding and applying various ML algorithms for prediction and classification.\n","6. **Model Evaluation and Validation:** Assessing model performance and validating results.\n","7. **Data Visualization:** Presenting insights effectively using visual representations.\n","8. **Practical Applications:** Applying data science techniques to real-world problems and datasets.\n","9. **Collaboration and Communication:** Communicating findings and collaborating effectively within teams.\n","10. **Ethical Considerations:** Understanding ethical implications and responsibilities in data science.\n","\n","These objectives aim to cover the fundamental aspects of data science, from data handling and analysis to model building and ethical considerations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the field.\n","\n","## Author\n","\n","**Suvarna Chand**  \n","*Data Scientist and Analyst*  \n","*Email: [author@gmail.com]*\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python","language":"python","name":"conda-env-python-py"},"language_info":{"name":""}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
